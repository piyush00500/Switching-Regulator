# ⚡ Switching Regulator Visualizer — Buck & Boost

This is an interactive web-based visual simulator that demonstrates how a DC-DC switching regulator works.  
Users can change **duty cycle, frequency, and load resistance**, and instantly see how **Vout, inductor current, and switch waveform** respond.

---

## 🎯 Features
- Interactive UI — sliders to control parameters
- Supports **Buck** and **Boost** converter modes
- Real-time waveform animation using HTML Canvas
- Hover tooltips explaining circuit components
- Smooth UI with custom CSS + JavaScript simulation

How to Use This Code — 5 Theoretical Bullet Points 

1️⃣ This HTML code creates a visual simulation interface to demonstrate how switching regulators (buck & boost) behave.
2️⃣ The user can interact using sliders to control duty cycle, frequency, and load to observe voltage and current changes.
3️⃣ JavaScript dynamically calculates Vout using ideal formulas and simulates waveform behavior on canvas in real-time.
4️⃣ CSS handles UI styling, giving a dark-theme dashboard layout, responsive design, and component-hover tooltips.
5️⃣ The circuit diagram is drawn using inline SVG, letting users click/hover to understand component function visually.
