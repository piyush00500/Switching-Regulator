# ⚡ Switching Regulator Visualizer — Buck & Boost

This is an interactive web-based visual simulator that demonstrates how a DC-DC switching regulator works.  
Users can change **duty cycle, frequency, and load resistance**, and instantly see how **Vout, inductor current, and switch waveform** respond.

---

## 🎯 Features
- Interactive UI — sliders to control parameters
- Supports **Buck** and **Boost** converter modes
- Real-time waveform animation using HTML Canvas
- Hover tooltips explaining circuit components
- Smooth UI with custom CSS + JavaScript simulation

## How to Use This Code  

- This HTML code creates a visual simulation interface to demonstrate how switching regulators (buck & boost) behave.
- The user can interact using sliders to control duty cycle, frequency, and load to observe voltage and current changes.
- JavaScript dynamically calculates Vout using ideal formulas and simulates waveform behavior on canvas in real-time.
- CSS handles UI styling, giving a dark-theme dashboard layout, responsive design, and component-hover tooltips.
- The circuit diagram is drawn using inline SVG, letting users click/hover to understand component function visually.
